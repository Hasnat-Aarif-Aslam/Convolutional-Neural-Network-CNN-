# **Uses:**

* Widely used for Image Classification

* **Object localization**
  * Where particular object is present in the image
    
  * Purpose: Identifies the location of one or more objects in an image.
    
  * Output: Draws a bounding box around each detected object.
    
  * Example: Given an image with a single cat, the model will draw a box around the cat to indicate its position.

* Object Detection
  * Purpose: Combines object localization and classification.
    
  * Output: Detects multiple objects in an image, draws bounding boxes around them, and assigns a class label to each object.
     
  * Example: Given an image with a cat and a dog, the model will draw boxes around both animals and label them as “cat” and “dog” respectively.
 

* Face Detection

* **Image Segmentation:**

* Super Resolution:
  * Uplifting (Increasing the resolution of images)
 
* Converting black/white images to colorful images

* Pose Estimation
